""" Each chemical element has a standard symbol that is one, two or three letters long.
One game that some people like to play is to determine whether or not a word can
be spelled using only element symbols. For example, silicon can be spelled using
the symbols Si, Li, C, O and N. However, hydrogen can not be spelled with any
combination of element symbols.
Write a recursive function that determines whether or not a word can be spelled
using only element symbols. Your function will take two parameters: the word that
you are trying to spell and a list of the symbols that can be used. Your function will
return two results: a Boolean value indicating whether or not a spelling was found,
and the string of symbols used to achieve the spelling (or an empty string if no spelling
exists). Your function should ignore capitalization when searching for a spelling.
Create a program that uses your function to find and display all of the element
names that can be spelled using only element symbols. Display the names of the elements along with the sequences
of symbols. """
