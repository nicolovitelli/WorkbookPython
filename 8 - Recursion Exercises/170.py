""" Create a program that determines whether or not it is possible to construct a particular
total using a specific number of coins. For example, it is possible to have a total of
$1.00 using four coins if they are all quarters. However, there is no way to have a
total of $1.00 using 5 coins. Yet it is possible to have $1.00 using 6 coins by using
3 quarters, 2 dimes and a nickel. Similarly, a total of $1.25 can be formed using 5
coins or 8 coins, but a total of $1.25 can not be formed using 4, 6 or 7 coins.
Your program should read both the dollar amount and the number of coins from
the user. It should display a clear message indicating whether or not the entered dollar
amount can be formed using the number of coins indicated. Assume the existence of
quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies when completing this problem. Your solution
must use recursion. It can not contain any loops. """
