""" Write a recursive function that determines whether or not a word can be spelled using only element symbols.
 Your function will require two parameters: the word that are you trying to spell and a list of the symbols that can
 be used. It will return a string containing the symbols used to achieve the spelling as its result, or an empty string
 if no spelling exists. """
