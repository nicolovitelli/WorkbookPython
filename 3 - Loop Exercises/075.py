""" The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, n and m, is the largest number,
d, which divides evenly into both n and m. There are several algorithms that can be
used to solve this problem, including: Initialize d to the smaller of m and n.
While d does not evenly divide m or d does not evenly divide n do. Decrease the value of d by 1,
Report d as the greatest common divisor of n and m. Write a program that reads two positive integers
from the user and uses this algorithm to determine and report their greatest common divisor. """
