""" Write a program that converts from letter grades to grade points and vice-versa.
Your program will convert multiple values entered by the user, with one value
entered on each line. Begin by attempting to convert each value entered by the
user from a number of grade points to a letter grade. If an exception occurs during
the attempt then your program should attempt to convert the value from a letter grade to a number of grade points.
If both conversions fail then your program should provide a message indicating that the supplied input is invalid.
Design your program so that it continues performing conversions until the user enters a blank
line. Your solutions to Exercises 51 and 52 may be helpful when completing this exercise. """
