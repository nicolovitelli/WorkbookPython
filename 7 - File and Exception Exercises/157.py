""" In this exercise, you will create a program that reads every file in the baby names data
set described in Exercise 154. As your program reads the files, it should keep track
of each name used for a boy and each name used for a girl. Your program should
output two lists. One list will contain all of the names that have been used for girls.
The other list will contain all of the names that have been used for boys. Neither of
your lists should contain any repeated values. """
